This project was started by Rasha E. Boulos.

Genomics first integrated into our dashboard at https://bioinfo.lau.edu.lb/gkhazen/covid19/

to complement the testing statistics timeseries (ref repo covid19-testing-data)

This repo works with the repo `covid19-genomics-data`



## How to use

The pipeline for publishing to the arcgis dashboard are in `1-comparative` and are run as follows:

First, files from Rim:

- l1a_parse_gisaid_fasta.R, l1b_mummer.sh, l1c_stats.R (in this order)

The scripts assume the following files are in the same directory as the code:
- `Reference/EPI_ISL_402125.fasta`
- `MainFile/somefile.fasta` (thatâ€™s the file i download from gisaid)
- `orfs_covid19.txt`


Second, code from Rasha

- l2a_snpEff.sh
- l2b_files4dashboard.R


Third, postprocessing by Halim:

- `l3b_postprocess_genomics.py`: by Halim, used before uploading to arcgis.com
  - The jupyter notebook from which this was derived is the l3a file
